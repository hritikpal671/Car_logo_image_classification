# Car_logo_image_classification_by_Hritik_Pal

This repository contains code and information related to a Car logo image classification project. The project focuses on using pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures to classify different logos in images.

## Project Overview

Logo image classification is the task of training a Computer Vision model to recognize and categorize different logos present in images. The project involves using pre-trained CNN architectures, data preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation on a test dataset/Images.

## Jupyter Notebook Files

- `Logo_image_classification.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook contains the code and step-by-step walkthrough of the logo image classification project. It includes data loading, preprocessing, model building, hyperparameter tuning, training, evaluation, and prediction.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow (or TensorFlow-GPU for GPU support)
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- numpy
- Pre-trained CNN architectures

You can install the required dependencies using the following command:

```
pip install tensorflow scikit-learn matplotlib numpy
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/hritikpal671/Car_logo_image_classification.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd logo-classification
```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

```
jupyter notebook Logo_image_classification.ipynb
```

4. Follow the instructions in the Jupyter Notebook to run the code cells and perform logo image classification.

## Results

After running the code in the Jupyter Notebook, the model was successfully able to recognize logo's of different car brands, for more you should see the training progress, validation accuracy, and test accuracy.
